# Project 2: moneymoo

## Project Overview
During the second unit of the GA Software Engineering course, we were tasked with developing a full-stack app from scratch using the MEN (MongoDB, Express, and Node.js) framework.

My project idea was "moneymoo", a stock tracker app that allows users to manage their investment portfolios, track trade history, and view unrealized gains and losses. Users can search for real-time stock prices, access company financial data, and easily add stocks to their watchlist for quick reference. Built with a focus on functionality and user experience, this app integrates stock market APIs to provide accurate and up-to-date information for investors and traders alike.
